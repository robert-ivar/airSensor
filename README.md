# airSensor
#### Introduction
Good indoor air quality has significant impact on health (Abdul-Rahman et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2023). This projects revolves around gathering data about the quality of my indoor air. It's a part of a larger effort to improve the air quality of my living space which I suspect may be bad at times. I also work in a soil laboratory which I highly suspect to host hazardous air quality.

To do this, I assembled a small computer which collects information on CO2 and suspended particulate matter levels. I wanted to be able to read the levels at a glance on a screen as well as upload the data to a server which can then give me an overview over a longer period of time.
